    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my favorite chocolate chip pancake recipe — it's so easy! I often make it for family and friends. You may
        want to double the recipe because these soft, fluffy pancakes go quickly.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted and cooled</li>
        <li>½ cup miniature chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk milk and egg together in a bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl. Stir in melted butter, then whisk in milk
            mixture until smooth. Fold in chocolate chips.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a small nonstick skillet over low heat. Pour about 1/3 cup batter into the hot skillet and cover with a
            lid. Cook pancake until browned on the bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip pancake, then cover and cook until
            browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove to a plate and repeat to make remaining pancakes.

    </ol>
